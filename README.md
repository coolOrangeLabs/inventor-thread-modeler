## Description

The threadModeler tool has been developed to allow Autodesk® Inventor® users to generate a realistic modeled equivalent thread based on an existing Inventor thread feature. Users are able to select an existing thread feature in the model, which the threadModeler then converts to a realistic 3D modeled thread based on the underlying thread feature properties.

Modeled threads are accurately generated saving a lot of time and effort for the user when compared with a manual approach, bringing a higher degree of realism to your models.

Please watch this short [video](https://coolorange.wistia.com/medias/9hf3s50g6m) for an overview of the threadModeler.
